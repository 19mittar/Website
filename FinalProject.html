                                            In my opinion, this final project was the most valuable team experience that we had throughout the entire camp because it provided a sample of real life software development. 
                                            To start off, everyone was assigned a task in groups as we were encouraged to utilize pair-programming. 
                                            Using this technique made it a lot easier to catch any errors and greater efficiency while coding. 
                                            Since we had to borrow a lot of the code from class activities, the naming of methods and classes got challenging. 
                                            Additionally, one of the biggest struggles our team had was implementing the search function. The code we had would not display anything since the new list was not getting filled.
                                            After numerous attempts along with lots of Internet searching, the search functionality finally worked. 
                                            After the search function, our team had to handle the styling aspect. We were looking for a design that was very simplistic and easy to use which I think we have accomplished. 
                                            Finally at the end, we had to merge all the components together which happened with ease. 
                                            Overall, this project allowed to get a taste of what the rest of the summer will look like, along with allowing us to practice all the skills we learned throughout the summer camp.
