                                            During our process for unit conversion, my team and I had to utilize a variety of new techniques involving CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 
                                            When we first received this task, we initially had to create a style sheet and mock up sheet for the website. 
                                            However, we realized that we had been spending too much time on the styling so decided to work on the javascript aspect of the website first. 
                                            Then, source control had to be utilized to combine all of the different conversion pages into one website. 
                                            One problem that we faced was maintaining a constant design throughout all the pages. 
                                            Each page initially had a different header and overall design which had to continually be altered in the style sheet. 
                                            Additionally, Mr. O gave us a surprise time limit on when the website had to be done. In order to meet this time limit, we utilized incorrect source control and did not do pull requests in order to save time. 
                                            However, looking back, I realize that this was incorrect source control and that it should never be compromised even if there is a time constraint. 
                                            Overall, I feel like our team evolved well and learned lots of new things along the way ranging from design, to javascript, to source control.
