                                           This part of the portfolio really helped me understand MVC and Full Stack development. 
                                           The chemistry of our team had been well established at this point enabling us to work together efficiently. 
                                           In the beginning, we got a little too hung up on the design aspect rather than the functionality but we later realized this and began to work on the functionality. 
                                           Since a lot of the conversion work was completed in the client-side activity, we were able to quickly wrap up the functionality aspect. 
                                           However, in the end, we ran into a few issues. First off, one of our team members was not present for the day we worked on it which made it challenging to keep up a good pace. 
                                           Additionally, my conversion (Celsius To Fahrenheit) was different than the others in that if one unit was 0, the converted unit was never 0. This meant that if 0 was inputted in for Fahrenheit, it would not work (since the Fahrenheit conversion was in the second for loop).
                                           Finally, we had a multitude of merge conflicts to solve which were fixed utilizing good source control and pull requests involving working outside of the given time with my team. 
                                           Overall, I felt like this was a very valuable and informative experience allowing me to explore MVC further.
