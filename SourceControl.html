                                            FileIO was the first portfolio project that me and my team had to work on. 
                                            It gave us a chance to develop chemistry and learn how to work with one another. 
                                            Our team had no issue working together and evolved into a high paced and efficient team with the exercises during the camp. 
                                            In the beginning, we had some difficulty finding the code for inputting a file and had to reference Google multiple times to find and understand the code for this. 
                                            After multiple failed attempts, we were finally able to find code that worked. 
                                            Then we divided up the tasks and used source control to merge them together. 
                                            Another problem that we faced was using a Mac vs a Windows computer. 
                                            In the launch.json file, some changes had to be made to the console so that it read "integratedTerminal" in order for FileIO to work. 
                                            Overall, I felt that this was a very valuable first experience with my team which allowed me to further explore source control while working with my team.
