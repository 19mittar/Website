                                            This summer camp was a truly great experience that I am grateful to have been a part of. 
                                            The amount of content that we have covered in these three weeks is incredible and I am thankful for all of my mentors and Safenet for sacrificing time to teach us the material. 
                                            This camp has taught me a multitude of skills including good source control, full stack, and how to work in a team. 
                                            A great example of this is in our final project when we combined all aspects of this summmer camp into a real project. 
                                            In the beginning, I was confident in my Java however was nervous about the rest of the material since I had attempted it before the camp numerous times without success. 
                                            However, as the camp progressed, I practiced and learned all of the topics and realized that they weren't so bad after all. 
                                            My team was also very pleasant to work with as we were all willing to help each other out which made it easier for all of us. 
                                            Overall, this summer camp was amazing and I hope to be able to use the knowledge I gained in this camp to help give back to my community.
